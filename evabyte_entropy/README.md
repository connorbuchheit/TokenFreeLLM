**EvaByte** is a 6.5B **byte-level language model** built upon an improved architecture with multibyte prediction and EVA -- an efficient attention mechanism designed for scalability and performance. Trained on 1.5T bytes of natural language text, math, and code, EvaByte rivals top open-source tokenizer-based LMs using 5x less training data, excelling in coding tasks, and decoding up to 2x faster.

This repository provides the model implementation and inference examples for EvaByte.

## News

- [2025-03-19]: eval scripts are released.
- [2025-02-28]: new `triton` kernels are released for training.
- [2025-01-20]: EvaByte checkpoints and inference code are released.

## 🛠️ Model Implementation

Our implementation of EvaByte is based on the [Huggingface `transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, located in the `evabyte_hf` folder. Its attention mechanism, EVA, is adapted from this [repository](https://github.com/HKUNLP/efficient-attention) and implemented with a `triton` kernel -- performant but with room for further optimization. We also provide a native PyTorch implementation in `evabyte_hf/eva_pt_ref.py` for reference.

## Training

We provide a few triton kernels for EVA to accelerate training on GPUs. These kernels have been numerically validated against the native PyTorch implementation, and we've tested that training works at a limited scale. EVA (`evabyte_hf/eva.py`) might be also used as a standalone, more efficient alternative to standard self-attention modules in Transformers. However, due to resource constraints, we have not yet conducted large-scale training experiments nor developed an optimized codebase for GPUs; we are actively working on this and will provide updates when a minimal training pipeline is available for release.

**Note:** The input sequence length for training may be a multiple of 2048, which corresponds to the `window_size` in our current EvaByte implementation.

## 🚀 Inference with `transformers`

Inference on GPUs with `transformers` is supported -- please make sure you have `torch>=2.4`, `transformers`, and `triton>=3.0` installed.

### 📄 Base Model

**Note:** Make sure to set `trust_remote_code=True` when loading the model (or tokenizer), as our implementation includes custom code.

The code snippet below, which is also available in `example_completion.py`, demonstrates EvaByte-6.5B for completion:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("evabyte/EvaByte", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("evabyte/EvaByte", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, trust_remote_code=True).eval().to("cuda")

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps "

# Tokenize input
# Option 1: standard HF tokenizer interface
input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")

# Option 2: Direct UTF-8 byte encoding with offset
# Note: Each byte is offset by 64 with <bos> prepended.
input_ids = torch.tensor([[1] + [b + 64 for b in prompt.encode("utf-8")]]).to("cuda")

# byte-by-byte generation (default)
generation_output = model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids, 
    max_new_tokens=32
)
# alternatively, use faster multibyte generation
generation_output = model.multi_byte_generate(
    input_ids=input_ids, 
    max_new_tokens=32
)

# Decode and print the output
response = tokenizer.decode(
    generation_output[0][input_ids.shape[1]:], 
    skip_special_tokens=False,
    clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(response)
# Sample output:
# over the lazy dog.\n\nThe quick
```

### 💬 SFT Model

**Note:** Make sure to set `trust_remote_code=True` when loading the model (or tokenizer), as our implementation includes custom code.

Below (also available in `example_chat.py`) is an example of using **EvaByte-6.5B-SFT** for chat or instruction-following tasks. The model is trained with the [Llama-3 chat format](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/llama/tokenizer.py#L202), and we do not use a specific system prompt during supervised fine-tuning.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

# Load tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("evabyte/EvaByte-SFT", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("evabyte/EvaByte-SFT", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, trust_remote_code=True).eval().to("cuda")

# Prepare input messages
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write me an English pangram."}
]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_tensors="pt", 
).to("cuda")

# Byte-by-byte generation (default)
generation_output = model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids, 
    max_new_tokens=256
)
# Multibyte generation (faster alternative)
generation_output = model.multi_byte_generate(
    input_ids=input_ids, 
    max_new_tokens=256
)

response = tokenizer.decode(
    generation_output[0][input_ids.shape[1]:], 
    skip_special_tokens=False,
    clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(response)
# Sample output:
# An English pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. Here's a simple pangram:\n\n"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."<|eot_id|>
```

### ⚙️ Generation Modes

EvaByte supports two generation interfaces:
- `model.generate()`: The default generation method compatible with Huggingface `transformers` library. This approach generates one byte at a time and might be slow.
- `model.multi_byte_generate()`: A faster alternative that generates multiple bytes per step and usually yields the same result as `model.generate()` under greedy decoding, with the implementation adapted from [Medusa](https://github.com/FasterDecoding/Medusa). `model.multi_byte_generate()` supports a subset of arguments in `model.generate()`:
    - `input_ids`: the input byte ids.
    - `temperature`: the temperature for sampling.
    - `max_length`: the maximum length of the generated sequence.
    - `max_new_tokens`: the maximum number of new bytes to generate.
    - `stopping_criteria`: the [stopping criteria](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.47.1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.StoppingCriteria) for generation.
    - `top_p`: the top-p parameter for sampling.
    - `do_sample`: greedy decoding or sampling.

**Notes and Limitations:**
- `device_map="auto"` is not supported for >2 GPUs.
- Only batch size of 1 (with `attention_mask=None`) is supported for decoding.
- `torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16` is required.
- The multibyte generation `model.multi_byte_generate()` might return extra bytes after the end-of-sequence sentinel, due to the nature of the multibyte decoding. Manual truncation or cleaning may be needed.

## 📊 Evaluation
